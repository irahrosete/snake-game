# Snake Game

## Purpose and Scope

Snake is a game that surged to popularity in the late 90s and early 2000s when Nokia phones came preloaded with it. It is a classic game where a player starts with a short line that moves forward and is maneuvered within a bordered plane in order to eat items in the form of dots. The line keeps moving forward and grows in length according to the number of items eaten, resembling a snake. The aim of the game is to eat as much items without hitting the snake's own body, or in some versions, the borders.

This project aims to recreate the Snake game using Ruby. The project will apply object-oriented programming with the use of classes, defining methods and utilising algorithm knowledge that I've gained so far. In the process of developing the game, I also aim to learn more about grids and coordinates and collision detection, which are essential concepts to the game. In addition, I will also be learning about how to apply Ruby gems to make the game more interactive and use-friendly, as well as tapping into the power of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This will hopefully extend my Ruby knowledge and solidy my skills in programming.

The aim of the program is to entertain as well as provide some competitive incentive. There will be a scoring system. The score is updated and printed out as the game is played and a final score is printed out once the game is over. The program will have the ability to keep track of players that have played the game, and maintain a leaderboard. It will also have a notification system that can alert the top player in real-time once their score has been beaten.

The target audience is anyone from someone looking to have a break from a day's work, to someone who is looking to improve their basic coordination skills, to a master Snake gamer wanting to keep their lead recorded.


## Features
Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

300 words (approx. 100 words per feature)

## User Interface
Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

## Control Flow
Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.

## Implementation
Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

## Help
Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
